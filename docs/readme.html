<h1>Unique WordPress theme</h1>

<p class="first">The Unique theme was created to be a well-designed theme for multi-author blogs that have an enormous amount of content to share in an organized and readable fashion. This guide will show you how to use the theme and point out any special steps you need to take in using it.</p>

<p class="second">This theme is a parent theme.  What this means is that to customize it, you should be creating a child theme.  <em>Is it a theme framework?</em>  Some people might call it that.  All you need to know is that it's a solid, yet flexible, starting point for any blog.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started <small>(<a href="#toc">Table of Contents &uarr;</a>)</small></h2>

<p>
This theme was built with WordPress standards in mind.  You won't find anything out of the ordinary or be required to jump through crazy hoops just to use your WordPress theme.  Nearly every feature in this theme is a standard part of using WordPress.  So, if you're new to WordPress, the best place to start learning is the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">Codex</a>.
</p>

<p>
This theme uses the standard WordPress features to allow you to control some aspects of your site's design from within the admin.  The following list of things are located under the "Appearance" menu in the admin and are the things you'll want to set up specifically for the theme.  Note that you'll definitely want to set up your widgets and menus as these are the most important features.  The other features are mostly optional extras.
</p>

<h2 id="child-themes">Child Themes <small>(<a href="#toc">Table of Contents &uarr;</a>)</small></h2>

<p>
	If you plan to make modifications to the code of this theme, you should make them via a child theme.  If you make modifications directly to the Unique parent theme, you will lose those modifications when the theme is updated.  When you make modifications inside of the child theme instead, you can upgrade the Unique parent theme without worry of losing any changes you've made.  This means you can get things like bug fixes and new enhancements in the future.  If you modify Unique directly, you cannot get those updates.
</p>

<p>
	If you're unfamiliar with child themes, the following links will describe them in more detail and provide you with a sample child theme to use.
